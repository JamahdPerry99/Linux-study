"find / -type f -size +100M" this is finding file sizes over 100M
"find /etc -exec grep -l student {} \; -exec cp {} find/contens/\; 2>/dev/null"
"find /etc/-name '*' -type f | xargs grep "127.0.0.1" takes the output of the first command and uses it in the second one

# archiving files.

"tar" is used to compress, extract, or list

"tar -cvf my_archive.tar /home/etc" this archives the /home and /etc directory and saves the file name as my_archive.tar
"tar -tvf" will show contents of an archive
:tar -xvf my_archive" extracts to current directory

This example command is "tar -cvf /tmp/archive.tar /home /etc" This is copying the /etc and /home file and saving it into the /tmp file as archive.tar.

bzip2 uses "-j"




# Lab

1. Use tar to create a compressed archive of all files in the /etc and /opt directories. Write this archive to your home directory
tar czvf lab6.tgz /etc /opt
Verify using "tar tvf lab6.tgz"

2. Create a symbolic link to the archive you've just created in the /tmp directory

ls -s lab6.tgz /tmp/lab6.link

3. Remove the archive from your home directory. What happens to the symbolic link?
