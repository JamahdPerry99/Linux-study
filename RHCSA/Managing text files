# exploring common tools
"Head" is used to show first 10 lines

"Tail is used to show last 10 lines

example "head /etc/passwd"


"cat" dumps text file contents on screen
"tac" dumps text file contents on screen

# Using grep
"grep" is good to find text in files or in output
"ps aux | grep ssh" this is searching the text file for anything that contains ssh.
"grep student * 2>/dev/null" we are looking into a directory and searching for files that contains student

#Lab 

1. Use the head and tail to display the fifth line of the file /etc/passwd
"head -5 /etc/passwd"
"tail -5 /etc/passwd"
2. Use sed to display the fifth line of the file /etc/passwd(-n5p)

3. Use awk in a pipe to filter the last column out of the results of the command ps aux '{print $NF}'

4. use grep to show the names of all the files in /etc that have lines that contain the text 'root' as a word
grep 'root' * 2>/dev/null

5. Use grep to show all lines from all the files in /etc that contain exactly 3 characters
grep '^...$' * 2>/dev/null
6. Use grep to find all files that contain the string "alex", but make sure that "alexander" is not included in the result
grep 'alex *
